# The CDA+ program is hosting weekly meetings. Each CDA+ should attend one meeting per week. 
# However, each CDA+ has different availability for when they can meet. 

# Problem: Given a timetable of the availability of all CDA+ students,
# find the minimal number of meetings needed so that all CDA+ students can attend at least one.
# If there are multiple ways to have this minimal number of meetings, list all of the options.

# this script takes in a downloaded CSV timetable from needtomeet.com.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Change the below filepath to the name of the csv file. 
# If it doesn't work, rename the document using only letters (no spaces, no punctuation) and retry.
